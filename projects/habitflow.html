                HabitFlow is a React Native mobile application designed to promote healthy habit-building through engaging challenges and social support. It targets individuals who struggle with consistency, making habit formation more enjoyable by encouraging users to take on new challenges and connect with a supportive community.
                <br><br>
                To enhance motivation, HabitFlow includes an point system that rewards users for consistent habits. Unlike traditional trackers, the app prioritizes variety and collaboration by regularly offering new goals and enabling social interaction.
                <br><br>
                This project was developed collaboratively by a team of four. I contributed as a full-stack developer, working across the frontend, backend, and database.

                This app is built using React Native with Expo to streamline development and deployment across platforms. It utilizes React drawer navigation to provide smooth, intuitive app navigation. For backend services,
                Firebase powers authentication—including seamless Google sign-in—cloud Firestore database, storage, real-time database, and crash reporting through React Native Firebase modules. The UI is enhanced with packages 
                like @expo/vector-icons for icons, react-native-alert-notification for user alerts, etc. Additional utilities such as async-storage 
                for local data, image-picker for media uploads, and expo-blur for visual effects help create a polished user experience.
